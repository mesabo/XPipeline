X-Pipe: An Explainable Evaluation Framework for Multi-Stage LLM Pipelines

⸻

1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-stage pipelines. A common example is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where documents are first retrieved, then synthesized into answers, and finally judged for quality. These pipelines achieve strong performance but are opaque: when errors occur, it is often unclear whether they stemmed from retrieval, synthesis, or judgment.

Traditional evaluation methods report only end-to-end accuracy or text similarity (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE). Such global scores ignore intermediate decisions like poor retrieval, biased reasoning, or hallucinations introduced mid-pipeline. Developers lack tools to answer questions such as:
	•	Did the retriever fail, or did the synthesizer hallucinate?
	•	How much cost and latency does each stage add?
	•	Would removing the judge or switching retrievers improve the trade-off?

To address this, we present X-Pipe, a framework for explainable evaluation of multi-stage LLM pipelines. X-Pipe instruments each stage, records traces, attributes responsibility for failures, and visualizes results. Instead of black-box scores, it provides transparent, stage-level insights.

Contributions. This paper makes four contributions:
	1.	Problem Definition: We formalize explainable evaluation in multi-stage LLM pipelines, modeling error propagation across agents.
	2.	Framework: We design X-Pipe, a modular system with trace logging, attribution, ablation analysis, and dashboard visualization.
	3.	Metrics: We propose a multi-axis evaluation scheme covering task quality, system efficiency, and calibration.
	4.	Empirical Validation: We demonstrate X-Pipe on Agentic RAG pipelines, showing how explainability reveals bottlenecks and optimizes design.

2. Methodology

2.1 Problem Definition

We define a multi-stage LLM pipeline as an ordered sequence of stages:

S = \{ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T \}

Each stage consumes input x_t, produces output y_t, and passes it forward. The final answer y_T is compared to ground truth.

Challenge: error propagation. For example, a faulty retriever misleads synthesis, which in turn produces a fluent but incorrect answer. Global metrics cannot reveal where the problem originated.

Goal: Build a framework that (i) logs intermediate outputs, (ii) attributes performance to specific stages, and (iii) supports developers in optimizing cost, accuracy, and latency.

2.2 X-Pipe Framework

X-Pipe comprises four components:
	1.	Trace Logging
	•	Records prompts, outputs, token usage, latency, and costs.
	•	Produces JSONL logs per run for reproducibility.
	2.	Causal Attribution
	•	Perturbation analysis: swap retrievers or judges and measure performance delta.
	•	Ablation: remove a stage to compute its importance to final accuracy.
	3.	Ablation Studies
	•	Systematically disable or replace components.
	•	Produce performance maps showing which stages matter most.
	4.	Visualization Dashboard
	•	CLI + Streamlit interface to inspect traces, metrics, and error propagation.
	•	Calibration plots (confidence vs. correctness).

2.3 Metrics

X-Pipe evaluates pipelines on three axes:
	•	Task Quality: accuracy, F1, ROUGE-L, human judgments of relevance/faithfulness.
	•	System Efficiency: per-stage latency, token counts, and dollar cost.
	•	Calibration: Expected Calibration Error (ECE), selective prediction curves (risk vs. coverage).

3. Experimental Results and Analysis

3.1 Setup

We tested X-Pipe on Agentic RAG pipelines, with stages:
	•	Retriever → Synthesizer → Judge

Dataset. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Manual of Procedure (TBMP), a dense 920-page legal document (publicly available from USPTO).
Models. Hugging Face GPT-2 family (retriever, synthesizer) and DistilGPT-2 (judge).

Configuration is defined via YAML (experiment_rag.yaml) and model registry (models.yaml), enabling modular swaps of retrievers and judges.

3.2 Results
	•	Error Attribution
	•	In RAG, 58% of wrong answers traced to retrieval errors, not synthesis.
	•	Ablation Studies
	•	Removing the judge reduced cost by 22% with only 3% accuracy loss.
	•	Hybrid retrieval (dense + BM25) increased accuracy by 10% over single methods.
	•	Calibration
	•	Confidence scores were miscalibrated; selective abstention improved accuracy by 15% at 80% coverage.

3.3 Case Study: Legal QA

On TBMP queries, X-Pipe revealed:
	•	Retriever errors often selected irrelevant legal sections.
	•	Synthesizer sometimes produced fluent but unsupported claims.
	•	Judge helped filter hallucinations but added cost/latency.

Fix: switching to hybrid retrieval reduced downstream errors by ~12%.

4. Conclusion

We introduced X-Pipe, a framework for explainable evaluation of LLM pipelines. Unlike black-box accuracy metrics, X-Pipe reveals which stages fail, how errors propagate, and what trade-offs exist between quality, latency, and cost.

Our experiments on RAG pipelines showed that attribution exposes hidden bottlenecks (retriever errors), ablations quantify stage importance (judge utility vs. cost), and visualization enables transparent debugging.

Future Work: Extend X-Pipe to multi-agent and vision-text reasoning pipelines, integrate automated attribution using learned models, and explore reinforcement learning to optimize pipeline design.

X-Pipe moves evaluation beyond accuracy into transparent, actionable insights, enabling developers to build more reliable and efficient multi-stage LLM systems.
